Prevalence of the different skin cancers and diseases:

For this part we have used our cleaned version of the dataset(Without all the null values)

We have 741 Males and 753 Females in the study, so 1494 people in total.

We can from our data deepdive see the following split between genders:

BCC: Males 439 (59.23%), Females 406 (53.91%), Both genders 845 (56.55%)

ACK: Males 130 (17.54%), Females 153 (20.31%), Both genders 283 (18.94%)

SCC: Males 102 (13.76%), Females 90  (11.95%), Both genders 192 (12.85%)

NEV: Males 26  ( 3.50%), Females 49  ( 6.50%), Both genders 75  ( 5.02%)

MEL: Males 24  ( 3.23%), Females 28  ( 3.71%), Both genders 52  ( 3.48%)

SEK: Males 20  ( 2.69%), Females 27  ( 3.58%), Both genders 47  ( 3.14%)

From these statistics we can see a significant difference in the prevalence of Nevus, there are almost 2 females with the skin disease for 1 man with the skin disease. 
This might indicate some sort of weakness for this specific disease in Females. 
There is also a difference in Actinic Keratosis for males and females, here there is 17.54% prevalence for males and 20.31% prevalence for females. 
There is a difference in the prevalence of Basal Cell Carcinoma, here the prevalence for males is 59.23% while it is 56.55% for females. 
Finally for Seborrheic Keratosis the difference in prevalence is  2.69% for males and 3.58% for females, which is a quite big difference.
